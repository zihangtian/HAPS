### Dataset Background
The dataset we use is HotPotQA, where each data point includes a question and relevant information. We employ a multi-agent system comprising a Teacher and a Student agent to answer these questions. The agents alternate actions until either the search budget is exhausted or the Student provides a final answer.

### Student Agent Introduction
The Student agent is responsible for searching for information and answering the question, guided by the Teacher agent. The Student's action space includes:
- Search[entity]: This action uses a retrieval tool to search for relevant information from the dataset, constructed using the SimCSE model (unsup-simcse-roberta-base).
- Finish[answer]: This action returns the final answer and concludes the task.

### Teacher Agent Introduction
The Teacher agent evaluates and guides the Student agent by analyzing its steps and providing feedback. The Teacher can:
- [Continue]: Indicate that the Student's current step is correct and they should proceed.
- [Rethink]: Indicate that the Student's action is incorrect and they should reconsider their approach.
